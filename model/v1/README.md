## How to use me

- Create a virtual environments

  python -m venv env
  ```

- Activate env

  ```powershell
  env/Scripts/activate
  ```

- Install ipykernel using pip

## If you want to use own dataset

Set your file name ðŸ“¥

```python
  filename = YOUR_DATASET_FILENAME â¬…
  df = pd.read_csv(filename)
  df.head()
```

## How do we compare algorithm

Look at ðŸŽ¯

Select the algorithm having high mean and low stranded deviation, which is based on f1-score.

## What do we get

Look at ðŸ“„

After selecting your model set the model variable.

```python
  model = YOUR_MODEL_NAME â¬…
  dump(model, "model.xz")
```

That will create the model.xz file ready to use

## How to use model.xz

- First you to import joblib package.
- To load model use

  ```python
  model = joblib.load("model.xz")
  ```

- Now you can use model as same as earlier.
